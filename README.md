As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly

Getting Started
Copy the repository by downloading the zip file or git cloning into the folder of your choice as pictured below.



Use the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The following documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions (https://openweathermap.org/appid).

Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

Then open the application in your browser by right clicking on the weather.html file in your code editor and selecting 'Open in Default Broswer' as pictured below.
